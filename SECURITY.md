# Security

Please use the project's
[GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
page to report security issues.

Once the vulnerability has been confirmed and a fix implemented, a new release
will be published. This will usually be a patch-level release unless a more
significant major/minor-level release coincides with the fix.
