# Support

If you need assistance, we recommend either using our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/wtzCfaX2Nj),
[Zulip server](https://vezel.zulipchat.com), or the project's
[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) forums.

When seeking help, please note the following:

* Search GitHub and other relevant forums/channels to see if your question has
  been answered already.
* Apply [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com) first.
* When asking a question, [do not ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com).
* Avoid the [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info).
* Be as detailed about your problem as possible, including what you are trying
  to achieve, what methods you have tried, what the exact results of your
  attempts have been, and so on.
