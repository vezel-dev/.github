# Vezel GitHub Organization

This repository contains organization-wide GitHub files. These are used by
default on other repositories in the organization if those repositories do not
provide their own. The organization profile is also maintained here.

The [`syn`](syn) directory contains files that are shared across several
repositories in the organization. They are synchronized to those repositories
using [dotnet-file](https://www.clarius.org/dotnet-file).
